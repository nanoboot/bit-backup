== Description

WARNING: This command does not involve "Bit Backup" repository. Instead it is intended for additional control of integrity of files.

This command is intended for Bit Rot Detection (to keep your files forever).

 * Current hash sum of files is tracked in file bitbackupindex.
 * Previous hash sum of files is tracked in file bitbackupindexold.
 * Files bitbackupindex and bitbackupindexold are compared.
 * If the current and previous last modification date of a file are the same, but the calculated checksum is different, then a bit rot was detected.

Found bit rots can be probably repaired, but only in case, you used commands like init and create

Inspired by:
